# Mapping

Before moving to planning the path for our robot and what types of algorithms are useful we first want to have a map of the outside environment that our robot experiences. There are a lot of mehods for doing this and a lot of development has been done in the subject.

This paper is particularly about Octomap package, a package for voxel representation of the environment from the sensor data \(voxels are just 3D cubes \) but it covers in brief about the advancements in the field.  
 [**OctoMap: An Efficient Probabilistic 3D Mapping Framework Based on Octrees" \(PDF\), published in the Autonomous Robots Journal.**](http://www.arminhornung.de/Research/pub/hornung13auro.pdf)

**If you want a quick look on the octomap approach then watch this :** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzu8b6u8ONM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzu8b6u8ONM)                                                                        
**\(** it also describes the major mathematical aspects of the paper **\)**

In conclusion packages like octomap can store the 3D maps in a much more efficient way that can furtur be made used for furthur motion planning algorithms.
